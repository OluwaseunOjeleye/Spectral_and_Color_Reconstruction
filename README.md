# Spectral and Color Reconstruction

The Spectral and Color Reconstruction project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform spectral and color reconstruction of Hyperspectral Images. This is achieved through the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, three.js, WebGL 2.0 and GLSL. Prior to this, preprocessing and precomputation were carried out using the White Correction, PCA, and Colorimetry techniques which were implemented using Python.

A live demo of the project can be accessed at <a href="https://oluwaseunojeleye.github.io/Spectral_and_Color_Reconstruction/" target="_blank">https://oluwaseunojeleye.github.io/Spectral_and_Color_Reconstruction/</a>.
